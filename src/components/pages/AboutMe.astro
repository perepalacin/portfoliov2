            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>
                    I am <span>Pere Palac√≠n, a <span id="years-old"></span> years old Software Engineer</span> from Barcelona mostly <span
                        >Self-Taught</span
                    > with a great interest in developping data intensive applications (Full Stack or Backend mainly).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After my first few professional experiences as an Engineer, I rediscovered my <span>passion for programming</span> and Software
                    in general. I would consider myself someone really <span>hungry for learning</span> and developing my own Software Tools
                    offers me exactly that in order to
                    <span>keep up with the everchanging tech landscape.</span>
                    I particularly enjoy <span>diving deep into performance optimization</span>, trying to squeeze every bit of efficiency
                    out of the system<span> by understanding how frameworks work under the hood</span> while maintaining <span
                        >clean, testable, robust, and well-structured code.</span
                    >
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I coded for the first time in <span>middleschool using C</span>, I then learned
                    <span>Visual Basic in Highschool</span> and <span>Python at University.</span> During the last years, I have been studying
                    on my own <span
                        >Java, C and TypeScript. As well as other technologies and frameworks such as React, ExpressJS, Spring, SQL and
                        NoSQL</span
                    >. This Website is a record of my career as well as a collection of all the projects I've done so far using this
                    technologies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span>Please enjoy!</span>
